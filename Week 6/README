Brief Guide to Virtual Environments in Conda

Create a new virtual environment with the name advanced running on Python 3.9:
conda create --name advanced python=3.9

Activate the virtual environment advanced:
conda activate advanced

Install some packages using pip:
pip install torch
pip install torchvision
pip install matplotlib
pip install jupyter notebook

Deactivate the virtual environment:
conda deactivate

List packages within a virtual environment:
conda list

List all the virtual environments that you have created:

Remove a virtual environment with the name advanced (Please refrain from doing so until the end of this workshop series):
conda remove --name advanced --all
